      S.A.F.E.D. is a website that contains profiles on organizations and people
      that fall under the State and Federal Entity umbrella. The main page shows
      you the latest popular news articles linked with related people. It also
      shows the most popular profiles based on views. There is also a search
      function that allows you to search for either people or organizations in the
      database.
